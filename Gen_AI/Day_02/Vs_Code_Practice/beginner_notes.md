## 🤔 Why Choose VS Code?

### 1. **Perfect for Applications Development**
- VS Code is specifically designed for building real-world applications
- Unlike some basic text editors, VS Code provides advanced features that make coding easier

### 2. **Multi-Language Support**

VS Code supports many programming languages:
- **Python** 🐍
- **C/C++** ⚡
- **Java** ☕
- **JavaScript** 🌐
- **HTML & CSS** 🎨
- And many more!

### 3. **Python Development**
- The most preferred file extension for Python is `.py`
- VS Code has excellent Python support with extensions

### 4. **Cloud Integration**
- Direct connection to **Azure Applications**
- Easy deployment and cloud development

---

## 💻 Available Python Platforms

### Popular Code Editors for Applications:
1. **Visual Studio Code** (Recommended) ✅
2. **PyCharm** ✅
3. **Notepad++** ✅

### Important Note:
- There are many Python platforms available
- However, **not all platforms are suitable** for application development
- Choose platforms that support advanced features and debugging

## 🛠️ How VS Code Works with Python

### Writing Code:
- VS Code is used to **write** Python files (`.py` extension)
- Provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection

### Running Code:
- To **run** Python files, you need a Python terminal
- VS Code can write the code, but you need Python installed to execute it

---

## 🖥️ Available Terminals

On your laptop, you have **two main terminals** for running Python:

### 1. **Anaconda Prompt**
- Comes with Anaconda installation
- Pre-configured with data science packages
- Good for data science and machine learning projects

### 2. **VS Code Terminal**
- Built into VS Code
- Can access system Python or virtual environments
- Convenient for running code directly from the editor

## 🚀 Getting Started - Quick Steps

### Step 1: Install VS Code
1. Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Install Python extension

### Step 2: Install Python
1. Download Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Or install Anaconda for data science

### Step 3: Create Your First Python File
1. Open VS Code
2. Create a new file with `.py` extension
3. Write your Python code
4. Use terminal to run the code

### Step 4: Run Your Code
```python
# Example: hello.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

**To run:** Open terminal and type:
```bash
python hello.py
```

## � Basic Command Line (CMD) Commands

### Essential Navigation Commands:

#### **Directory Operations:**
```cmd
# Show current directory location
cd

# List files and folders in current directory
dir

# Change to a specific directory
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents

# Go back to parent directory
cd ..

# Go to root directory
cd \

# Create a new folder
mkdir my_project
```

#### **File Operations:**
```cmd
# Create a new empty file
type nul > filename.py

# Copy a file
copy source.py destination.py

# Delete a file
del filename.py

# Rename a file
ren oldname.py newname.py

# View file contents
type filename.py
```

### Python-Specific Commands:

#### **Running Python:**
```cmd
# Check Python version
python --version

# Run a Python file
python script.py

# Open Python interactive mode
python

# Exit Python interactive mode
exit()

# Install Python packages
pip install package_name

# List installed packages
pip list

# Check pip version
pip --version
```

#### **Virtual Environment Commands:**
```cmd
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate virtual environment
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Deactivate virtual environment
deactivate

# Install packages in virtual environment
pip install requests pandas numpy
```

### VS Code Terminal Commands:

#### **Opening VS Code:**
```cmd
# Open VS Code in current directory
code .

# Open specific file in VS Code
code filename.py

# Open VS Code with new window
code -n

# Open VS Code and wait for file to close
code -w filename.py
```

### Helpful Tips for Beginners:

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `dir` | Shows files in folder | When you need to see what's in a directory |
| `cd` | Changes directory | When you need to navigate to your project folder |
| `python filename.py` | Runs Python code | When you want to execute your Python script |
| `pip install` | Installs Python packages | When you need additional libraries |
| `code .` | Opens VS Code | When you want to edit files in current folder |

### Common CMD Shortcuts:

- **Tab** - Auto-complete file/folder names
- **↑** (Up Arrow) - Previous command
- **↓** (Down Arrow) - Next command
- **Ctrl + C** - Stop running program
- **Ctrl + L** or `cls` - Clear screen

### Example Workflow:
```cmd
# 1. Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\MyPythonProject

# 2. Create a new Python file
type nul > hello.py

# 3. Open VS Code to edit the file
code hello.py

# 4. After writing code, run it
python hello.py

# 5. Install any needed packages
pip install requests
```
