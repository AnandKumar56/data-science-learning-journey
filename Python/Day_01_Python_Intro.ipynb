    "- Cannot start with a number\n",
    "- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores\n",
    "- Case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different)\n",
    "- No spaces allowed (use underscore instead)\n",
    "- Cannot use Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `while`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Valid Examples:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name, age, _score, student_name, firstName, score2\n",
